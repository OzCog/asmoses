# although they work great, and pass in Debian Stable Bullseye and

# 12.2. So something about gcc or similar is causingthese failures.

# I don't have time to figure out what is going wrong with these.
# No one is maintaining this stuff, so the easiest thing to do is to just
# disable these, until some rainy day when someone looks at this stuff.
# You can enable these again, if/when the underlying bugs are fixed.
