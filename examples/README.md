AS-MOSES Examples
=================
AS-MOSES can be used in one of three ways: 
* Directly from the command line,
* By using AtomSpace Atomese interfaces,
* Embedding the low-level API into C++ programs.

For many users, the command-line interface is strongly recommended.

For users interested in integrating with other AtomSpace processes,
the Atomese interfaces are required.

Command-line examples
---------------------
Some datasets:

* example-data: Simple data sets on which moses can be run.

C++ programming API examples
----------------------------
These must first be built by saying (in the build dir):
```
    make examples
```
The available examples are:
* example-ant: Santa Fe Trail ant example
* example-progs: Other example programs.
